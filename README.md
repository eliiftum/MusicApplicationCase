# Music Application Case
## Features
- Likes Feature
- Preview Listening Feature

## Technologies and 3rd Party Libraries
- Developed with UIKit
- Cocoapods is used as depency injection manager
- MVC is used as architecture
- Userdefaults is used as Local Storage
- AVFoundation is used for listening to track's previews
- URLSession is used for Network Request
- I used a generic type to be able to use all models in a single network layer.
- I used the singleton architecture in all managers because it allows them to be instantiated only once and kept in memory throughout the application's lifetime.
- I used extensions to extend classes and add new features to those classes.
- I used closures to reload the collection view when any favorite song is removed from the list.
- I used segue for navigation between pages.
